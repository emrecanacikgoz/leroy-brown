        * LanguageEncoder trainings are implemented for both fc_in and mlp; lets see the val-acc difference.
        * Some other hyperparam experiments are on going, focusing on mlp.
        * It can easly overfit to train-acc; what is wrong with val-acc?
        * Try some noisy regularization tricks.
        * Check if the env-states and and robot-states match.
        * GoalEncoder should be added; (i) LangEncoder inputs only, (ii) all data with curriculm learning.
        * Can we train as a diffusion policy?
